# **Unity 3D Vision Simulation**

## **Project Overview**
This project is a **Unity-based simulation** for D vision and sensor calibration, developed as part of the **AUSLab** research activities at **Eötvös Loránd University (ELTE)**. The primary goal is to simulate and test 3D computer Vision algorithms .

 **NOTE:** The Project is still under development , Features and improvement are being actively improved.

## **Features**
 **Simulated LiDAR & Camera Sensors** – Users can add, manipulate, and calibrate sensors.  
**3D Object Spawning** – Generate test objects like **cylinders, planes, and chessboards**.  
**Transformations & Calibration** – Compute transformations between LiDAR and camera.  
**Customizable Sensor Parameters** – Both intrinsic and extrinsinc ; Adjust **FOV, resolution, max distance**, and more.  
 **Data Export** – Save **LiDAR point clouds** and camera images for further analysis.  
**Interactive UI** – Inspector-like interface for modifying sensor properties dynamically.
